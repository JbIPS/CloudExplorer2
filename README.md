# CloudExplorer2

## Install

```
$ npm i
```

This will compile the JS files from `src/` with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). The generated files will go in `dist/`.

You can serve `dist` on `http://localhost:8080` with 

```
$ npm start
```

This is what is done on heroku here: [a live demo](http://cloud-explorer.herokuapp.com/api/1.0/services/list)
